    Spring 2024
    Week 5 - code from class
    
    Data for this week:
        * Info about northeastern over the last several years
        * For 2013-2021, we have: Selectiveness Rating, Admission Rate,
            % of admitted students w/identity markers, tuition
    
    Starter code for Tuesday:
        * Read in data from several files about the last few years at NEU
        * Files live in a directory named data
        * (optional, put utils.py in another location and udpate system path
           that way you don't need to copy/move the file to your current dir)
        * Has functions to clean the data -- has $ and % and , mixed in nums
    
    During the lecture part, we'll cover
        * Time series data overview
        * Normalizing/scaling data
        * Moving average
    
    And then we'll code that stuff into this starter code. We want to learn
    and visaulize, in particular, tuition vs admission rates, and demographics.
