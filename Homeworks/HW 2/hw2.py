'''
In 2013, what was the mean finish time of the top 1000 runners?
What is the median age of the top 1000 runners in 2010? 
Apart from the US, which country had the most runners in 2023? 
How many women finished in the top 1000 in 2021?
What is the correlation (r-value) of year vs. the mean finish time of women in the top 1000?
What is the correlation (r-value) of year vs. the mean finish time of American runners in the top 1000?
If the 2020 race had actually happened, what would you predict to be the mean finish time of Americans in the top 1000?

Plot #1: A linear regression plot  modeling the relationship between year and mean finish times of American runners in the top 1000.

Plot #2: A plot showing how median age 
and average finish times have changed over time. 
Because finish times and ages are on quite different scales, 
use the min/max normalization from class to scale the data 
-- weâ€™ll cover it on Tuesday 2/6!

    Python week! This week we'er focusing on some python skills including:
        * creating/writing files
        * using the os library to navigate your directory structure
        * plotting with seaborn on top of matplotlib
        * dictionaries deep-dive
        * overview of other data structures (tuples, sets)
        * deep vs shallow copies
