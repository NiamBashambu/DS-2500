      "Recently divorced Rebecca Welton becomes the new owner of the fictional AFC Richmond, a struggling club in the Premier League. To seek revenge on her ex-husband who cheated on her multiple times and was never blamed for it, Rebecca resolves to hire the most incompetent coach she can find to ruin the club, as it was the only thing her ex ever loved. To this end she hires Ted Lasso, a college football coach from Wichita, Kansas. Ted has recently coached an NCAA Division II football team to a title, but knows nothing about soccer. Arriving in Richmond with his assistant, Coach Beard, he tries to connect with his new teammates with his positive, folksy charm, but the club hates him anyway. He is thought of as a rube, but it soon becomes clear he is smarter than he looks. In his apartment at night, he speaks to his son and wife on the phone and hints that he took the job because his wife had wanted \"space\". \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On his first day at AFC Richmond, Ted attempts to win over the players and management. He brings Rebecca shortbread as a present; she rebuffs his attempt at friendliness but becomes obsessed with the biscuits. He quickly sees the team has a division in the locker room: Roy Kent, an aging star, is constantly angry and at odds with Jamie Tartt, a young egotistical talent. Seeing that another player, Sam Obisanya, is homesick for Nigeria, Ted throws him a birthday party even though the team had lost a game earlier in the day. Trying to win over Jamie, Ted seeks advice from Keeley, Jamie's model girlfriend. She advises praise, which Ted does. In an attempt to cause more problems for the team, Rebecca has a tabloid photograph of Lasso and Keeley seemingly being intimate with each other, with the intent of enraging Jamie. It is revealed that Ted himself bakes the biscuits he gives Rebecca. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that tabloid newspaper The Sun has photographs of them, Ted and Keeley go to Rebecca. She has their publication stopped, fearful they will be traced back to her, but in exchange, Ted has to spend the day with Trent Crimm, a tough reporter for The Independent. Crimm arrives skeptical. He finds out Ted's new plays were conceived by Nate, the kit man. When Crimm asks him about the appropriateness of throwing Sam's birthday party after the previous week's loss, Ted tells him he's not concerned with wins and losses. Ted, Crimm, and Roy go to a local school event and win over the children. Roy reluctantly but assertively confronts Jamie and a few other players who have been bullying Nate. Ted invites Crimm to dinner, at a restaurant owned by the driver who picked him up at the airport. Ted, never having had Indian food before, gets very spicy food but eats it all to be polite. Crimm's write-up about the \"Lasso Way\" is positive, enraging Rebecca. \n",

      "The team loses again, prompting Roy and Jamie to fight even more. Rebecca, whilst preparing for the annual charity ball, learns that Robbie Williams canceled on her unexpectedly, so she relies on Higgins to find another musical act. Roy and Jamie constantly feud, setting Keeley on edge. Rupert Mannion, Rebecca's ex-husband, arrives and takes over the auction. Ted, who's trying to control Roy and Jamie's arguments, deduces that Rupert was the one responsible for Robbie Williams canceling in order to embarrass Rebecca. Rebecca later bonds with Keeley, and she convinces Keeley to break up with Jamie. Roy and Jamie make up and resolve not to fight anymore. Rebecca, enraged at Rupert's sudden appearance (and the fact that he donated one million pounds to the charity event to show her up) gets drunk with Keeley, and the two ride off in a rickshaw. Ted provides Higgins with a street performer Ted had encountered earlier to replace the previous musician, and he is met with great reception. \n",

      "Ted's wife, Michelle, and son, Henry, finally arrive, and they have fun together as a family until Ted finds his wife in tears. She confides in him that, although she desperately wishes this was not true, she doesn't love him anymore and has no idea why. She promises to keep trying regardless. Keeley attends a promotion shoot she had organized for Jamie. Rebecca and Roy both seem concerned that Keeley is wasting her time with Jamie, but Keeley reassures them that her relationship with Jamie is over. On the field, Jamie continues to refuse to pass to his teammates and scores goals alone, leading fans and commentators to believe that AFC Richmond is solely reliant on Jamie. Ted sees how bad this is for the team's morale and benches Jamie right before half-time. This is met with harsh criticism from fans. Unfazed, Ted encourages his team to embrace change and believe in themselves. The team works together and manages to break the 2–2 tie to win the match. Ted, Beard, and Nate rejoice with the team. Later that evening, Ted tells Michelle that she does not need to try for his sake to make their marriage work, bidding her and their son farewell. \n",

The press continues to treat Rebecca badly, calling her \"Old Rebecca\" after Bex, whose full name is also Rebecca, begins dating Rupert, and Jamie and Ted continue to clash over his role with the team. Jamie sees his power weaken when Dani Rojas, a new, enthusiastic player who is just as good as Jamie, joins the team. The two form a rivalry, but Dani gets mysteriously injured, and Ted learns of ghosts haunting the team's treatment room. Ted makes the team sacrifice something special to them to lift the curse, and even Jamie joins in, after inspirational words from Keeley. The next morning, Ted discovers that Jamie has been returned to Manchester City, who had loaned Jamie to AFC Richmond for the season. Dani tries to cheer him up, but nothing happens. \n",

The game is being held on the weekend of Rebecca and Rupert's wedding anniversary, so Keeley tags along to cheer Rebecca up. They meet Rebecca's old friend Flo \"Sassy\" Collins, who immediately takes a liking to Ted. That night, Ted, reluctant to sign the divorce papers, gets drunk and snaps at Nate. The next morning, Ted apologizes and asks Nate to share some of his ideas. Nate gives the team an inspiring, if insulting, pre-game speech, and they win the game. That evening, the team goes out to celebrate at a karaoke bar, where Rebecca reveals her beautiful singing voice. Ted tries to enjoy the evening, but suffers a panic attack and stumbles out of the building, where Rebecca finds and comforts him. Ted retreats to his hotel room, where he is visited by Sassy. Roy kisses Keeley, then leaves abruptly. Rebecca entertains a hotel waiter in her room. \n",

Later that night, Jamie visits Keeley and she asks him to stay. Keeley later admits to Roy that she slept with Jamie, and Roy talks to Ted, who enlists the help of the Diamond Dogs. They help Roy see another perspective. Ted thanks Rebecca for her help during his first panic attack and offers to help her when she meets other team owners later that afternoon at a pub. There, Rebecca is blindsided by Rupert. In response, Ted makes a wager with Rupert over a game of darts. Ted wins, much to Rebecca's delight. On their way to dinner, Keeley and Roy's kiss is caught on camera by a paparazzo, but Roy forcefully takes the paparazzo's memory card. The next morning in Rebecca's office, Higgins implores her to stop ruining the team and quits. Keeley then storms into the office, having realized Rebecca's plan after finding the picture of her and Ted that was meant to appear in The Sun on the camera card. She threatens to tell Ted if Rebecca does not do it first. \n",

      "Rebecca still has not told Ted about her attempts to sabotage the team, and on the pitch, Roy is showing his age and there are calls to bench him. Ted refuses to do it, alienating him from the others. After Keeley's prompting, Rebecca tries to tell Ted but finds she cannot, and immediately afterward, Rupert comes and tells her he's having a baby with Bex. Rebecca marches down to Ted's office and confesses, and to her surprise, he easily forgives her. Ted tells Roy he is benching him. Roy feels betrayed and goes to Keeley, who tells him he is more than just a footballer. Having been forgiven, Rebecca then seeks out Higgins and apologizes to him. Higgins returns to the club. In the bar, after Ted again states he is not concerned about wins, Beard angrily tells Ted that these are professionals and not student-athletes, and that winning is important to him and the players. Ted finds Roy outside the pub and the two talk. Roy admits his age and they agree that they will claim Roy is injured so as not to embarrass him with a benching. At the next practice, Roy surprises Ted by showing up and donning a second team pinny, accepting his new role while still leading the team as they approach their last match. \n",

      "Nate is promoted to assistant coach, and he shows an inspirational video interview of Jamie, but after Jamie insults the team, they don't watch it, and one of them smashes the screen. Rebecca inspires Ted to cause chaos on the pitch and confuse the other team. In the final match of the season, Manchester City takes the lead of 1–0 in the second half, but Richmond pulls a trick play set-piece and scores to tie up the match; however, it is hopeless as Jamie makes an extra pass to a teammate who scores and wins the game for Manchester City. Consequently, Richmond are relegated to the Championship. Heartbroken by the result and relegation, Ted attempts to cheer everyone up with some advice he offered Sam earlier in the season, and that together they will get through it. Coach Beard brings Jamie an envelope from Ted with a letter congratulating him for the extra pass and a toy soldier to look after him, having seen his father berate him for not scoring. Meeting with Rebecca the next morning, Ted attempts to resign, but she rebuffs him; instead, together they decide to win promotion next season, and then to win the Premier League once they are back. \n",

Dani prepares to kick a game winning penalty, but he accidentally kills Richmond's greyhound mascot Earl; his resulting guilt cripples his ability to play. To help Dani recover from his \"yips\", Richmond hires sports psychologist Sharon Fieldstone, whose stern and disciplined attitude clashes with Ted. After meeting with Sharon, Dani regains his enthusiasm for football and converts a corner kick goal in practice. As a result, more players begin to request sessions with Sharon. Meanwhile, a newly retired Roy is coaching an Under 9 Girls Football team and dating Keeley. Jamie is shown to be a contestant on Lust Conquers All, a Love Island-style reality show. \n",

Jamie approaches Ted to rejoin Richmond and reveals that he left Manchester City to anger his abusive father. Ted politely declines his request to rejoin. When a picture of their conversation goes viral, Sam believes Jamie, who repeatedly bullied him, is returning and angrily storms off during practice. Ted assures Sam that he said no. After the girls' team Roy coaches lose their championship, Keeley convinces Roy to try out a pundit job at Sky Sports. Despite his heavy cursing drawing the disapproval of his other pundits, Roy's commentary is positively received by the public and the network asks him to return. Wanting to give Jamie a second chance, Ted reconsiders adding him to the team and polls the Diamond Dogs on their opinions. Higgins votes for the addition, while Beard and Nate vote against it. Roy admits to Keeley that he enjoyed being on the show. Jamie rejoins Richmond, to the players' confusion. \n",

Sassy's daughter (and Rebecca's goddaughter) Nora comes to visit, and spends a day with Rebecca at work. Sam participates in a photoshoot for Dubai Air, the team's sponsor, but later learns from his father that Dubai Air is owned by an oil company polluting his home country of Nigeria. He withdraws from the ad campaign, prompting pressure on Rebecca from Dubai Air to fire Sam, but she holds firm at Nora's urging. During Richmond's next game, Sam and fellow Nigerian players Isaac and Winchester cover their uniforms' Dubai Air logos with tape in protest; Jamie leads the rest of the team to follow suit. Ted lets Sam speak about Dubai Air's malfeasance and the Nigerian government's corruption during the postgame press conference. Jamie toasts Sam for his courage, and the two reconcile. \n",

Rebecca, suspecting Ted would feel alone in his first post-divorce Christmas, brings him along to give gifts to underprivileged children across town. Roy and Keeley learn Phoebe's classmate is bullying her for bad breath; they trace the problem to the antihistamine she takes for a cat allergy, and take Phoebe to make amends with her bully using handwritten notes. Higgins and his family host a Christmas party for foreign players who are unable to visit their families at home.

After Rebecca and Keeley teach Nate to be more assertive and confident, he successfully obtains the window reservation. Rebecca becomes interested in her new match on Bantr, an anonymous dating app co-owned by Keeley and sponsoring Richmond. Richmond continues to struggle, in part due to team captain Isaac's anxiety hampering his leadership. Roy helps him by taking him and Ted to a field near his childhood home and having Isaac play a pickup match with neighborhood footballers, reminding him to have fun while playing. While commentating on his Soccer Saturday show, Roy watches a newly enthusiastic Isaac on the pitch and realizes he misses being involved with the game. He abruptly leaves the broadcast and makes his way to Richmond's stadium, where he joins Ted's coaching staff, to the applause of the Richmond supporters and Nate's chagrin. \n",

Beard and Jane get back together; Higgins is advised by Ted and Roy not to voice his apprehensions. Richmond enjoys newfound success with Roy on the coaching staff. Jamie is upset that Roy refuses to give him coaching advice; Roy eventually relents and tells Jamie he needs to occasionally play more aggressively, telling him the coaches will provide him a signal for when to do so. While in a close game against Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-final of the FA Cup, all four coaches give Jamie the signal - raising their middle finger at him - leading to him scoring a goal. Ted suddenly has a panic attack and leaves the pitch; with Richmond in disarray, Spurs score.

During the third visit, however, Ted apologizes for his outburst and decides to commit to the therapy process. Roy unwittingly begins spending every moment he can with Keeley, to the point where she feels smothered; the two fight after Roy learns that Keeley has been complaining about his overbearing behavior to Rebecca and others.

Nate sees himself going viral on Twitter for the triple-substitution that resulted in Richmond's recent win, but his insecurity worsens when his stern father advises humility instead of praising his achievement. As a result, Nate begins behaving cruelly to others in the locker room – first to Colin, a young Welsh player who used to bully him, and later to Will, the new kit man. \n",
